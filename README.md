- 👋 Hi, I’m @elmaas
- 👀 I’m interested in battery materials, data analysis, sustainability and the outdoors!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to share the data analysis scripts I have written during my PhD in GIT, and how to use version control (yup)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that matches my ability and where I can improve my skillset :)
- 📫 How to reach me ...
